LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression is a linear model that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance prediction accuracy. 
It adds an L1 penalty to the loss function, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting only the most important features.
